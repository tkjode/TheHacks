# Home Server Restack Plan

## Idea

Leverage additional useful docker features to create functionality focussed stacks instead of one gigantic docker-compose file.

## Planned Stacks

Each stack will be a functional theme:

- Monitoring
- Network Services
- Development
- NNTP Index and Downloaders
- Game Servers
- Server Management
- Office/Productivity
- Data Management

## Isolation

Each stack should roughly be one unique network where container connectivity is useful.
